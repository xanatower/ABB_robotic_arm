Create a [FRAME] component and put your task frames into it.
Right click and select "internalise data"
Copy that component into a separate grasshopper file. Save it and upload to this folder.


REMEMBER: You will need to scale up you geometry slightly to go from working with the MD-Fab to the ABB. The file "Robot Workshop -Winter 2016" in the shared folder has an outline of the ABB working area to give you some idea but you may need to check with us first.
